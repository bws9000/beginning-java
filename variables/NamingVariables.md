#Variables
##Naming Conventions
Variable names are **case sensitive**.

For example:

myVariable and MyVariable are two different variables.

*A class name should start with a capital letter.*


*A variable should start with a lowercase letter.*

###Recommended Legal Class Name Example
* MyClassName

##Recommended Legal Variable Name Example
* myVariable

You can start a variable with an '$' or '_' character but it is not recommended. Your name should make an effort to describe the purpose of the variable if you can.

###Bad Naming Practice
####bad variable names:
* $myVar
* $12345
* _variable2
####bad class names:
* myclass
* _Myclass
* $fdsa

###Constant Variable names:
* STEERING_WHEEL = 1
* WHEEL_NUMBER = 4
